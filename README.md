# Criminal Forensics
 a forensic analysing program where we catch criminals by matching fingerprints and any DNA sequence found at crime scenes to existing fingerprints and DNA sequences in our database
 
 The main objective of our program is to accept fingerprints and DNA sequences. On the webpage we have options to either match by only fingerprints, match by only DNA, or match by both fingerprint and DNA.
